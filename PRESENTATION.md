# üé§ HACKATHON PRESENTATION GUIDE

## üéØ PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Name:** Climate Communication Platform  
**Tagline:** "Local climate facts ‚Üí simple words ‚Üí practical actions"  
**Built With:** Next.js 15 + Gemini 2.0 Flash + Open-Meteo Climate API

---

## üìã ELEVATOR PITCH (30 seconds)

"We built an AI-powered web platform that makes climate data accessible to EVERYONE in India - from a 5-year-old child to a climate scientist. It takes real IPCC climate projections for any location, uses Google's latest Gemini 2.0 Flash AI to explain it in 14 Indian languages at 4 different literacy levels, and gives practical actions people can take TODAY. Plus, it speaks out loud for those who can't read."

---

## üéØ PROBLEM WE SOLVED

**The Challenge:**

- Climate data is too technical for most people
- Available only in English
- No actionable steps for individuals
- Not accessible to lower literacy populations

**Our Solution:**

- Translate IPCC climate science into simple words
- Support 14 Indian languages
- Give 5-10 practical actions anyone can take
- Text-to-speech for accessibility

## üé¨ LIVE DEMO SCRIPT

### Step 1: Landing Page (15 sec)

"First, users choose their preferred language. Let me select **Tamil** and set literacy to **Basic** level for someone aged 10-15."

### Step 2: Location Selection (20 sec)

"Now I'll select Chennai - we have auto-detection or manual search. I can also try Coimbatore or Madurai."

### Step 3: Fetch Data (15 sec)

"Clicking 'Get Climate Data' - this calls the Open-Meteo API for real CMIP6 climate projections..."

### Step 4: View Results (30 sec)

"Here we see:

- **Left panel:** AI-generated simple explanation in Tamil
- **Right panel:** Climate metrics - temperature up by 2.1¬∞C, 58 hot days above 35¬∞C expected
- **Below:** 10 practical actions like 'Plant shade trees', 'Fix water leaks', 'Use LED bulbs'"

### Step 5: Voice Playback (20 sec)

"And here's the magic - I can play it in voice! This helps people who can't read. The browser speaks it in Tamil."

### Step 6: Switch Literacy Level (20 sec)

"Let me change to **Expert** level in **English** - see how the same data is now explained with technical terms like 'CMIP6 projections' and 'temperature anomaly'."

**Total Demo Time:** ~2 minutes

## üí¨ ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### Q: "Why not use ChatGPT instead of Gemini?"

**A:** Gemini 2.0 Flash is optimized for Indian languages and has better free tier limits (1M tokens/month vs ChatGPT's 3 requests/minute).

### Q: "How accurate is your climate data?"

**A:** We use IPCC's CMIP6 models via Open-Meteo - the same data used by climate scientists worldwide.

### Q: "Does it work offline?"

**A:** Currently needs internet for APIs. Post-hackathon, we can add Progressive Web App features for partial offline use.

### Q: "How do you prevent AI hallucinations?"

**A:** We give the LLM ONLY real data in prompts and explicitly instruct "do NOT invent statistics." Plus, rule-based actions don't use LLM.

### Q: "Can this scale to millions of users?"

**A:** Yes! Gemini free tier: 15 req/min, Open-Meteo: unlimited. For millions, we'd add Redis caching (same location = cached response).

### Q: "What's your monetization plan?"

**A:** Freemium - free for individuals, paid for institutions (schools, NGOs, government). Premium features: advanced analytics, custom reports.

## üéØ CLOSING STATEMENT

"Climate change affects everyone, but climate information doesn't reach everyone. We built this platform to bridge that gap - making IPCC-level science accessible to a child in Tamil Nadu or a farmer in Punjab. It's not just about awareness; it's about ACTION. And we built it with the latest tech stack, ready to scale from day 1. Thank you!"
